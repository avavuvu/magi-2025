In "Tumpengan", players assemble a puzzle together to form an illustration of a classic Indonesian scenery; mountains surrounded by farm fields and bodies of water. Once fully assembled, through augmented reality, players can view the scenery transforming into a Tumpeng platter; a celebratory Indonesian dish of cone-shaped yellow rice served with many side dishes. The players have essentially worked together in a spirit of 'Gotong Royong' - collaborative communal effort, which fruits of labor can be enjoyed hand in hand.
