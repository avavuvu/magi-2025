For the PLAY & BODY theme in Advanced Play Design class, I created an inclusive, social game inspired by menâ€™s bathroom urinal etiquette quizzes. Players interact by choosing answers to scenario dilemmas, by walking up to the correct urinal as difficulty increases each level. The game encourages everyone to experience and navigate a common situation men face in public bathrooms, turning a quirky internet test into an engaging, interactive activity for everyone. This encourages discussion and playful exploration of everyday social norms.
