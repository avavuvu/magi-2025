“Slow Down, Look Around” explores how animation can capture the feeling of slowing down and truly seeing nature. Inspired by childhood memories of watching fish, flowers, snails, and stars, the work invites viewers to pause, appreciate the world around them, and remember that nature’s quiet beauty is always there—if we take the time to notice.
