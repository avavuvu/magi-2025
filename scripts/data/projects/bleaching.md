Project inquiry: How can 3D animation use advertising’s visual language to repackage ecological disaster as a compelling consumer product? This project uses 3D animation to critique how visual languages disguise environmental crises. It links coral bleaching to consumerism, reframing the tragedy through the cynical lens of advertising. By paralleling toothpaste advertising aesthetics with reef bleaching, it questions ideals of “purity” and “cleansing.”
