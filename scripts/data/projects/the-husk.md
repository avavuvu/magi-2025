“The Husk” is a hand-drawn animated short that immerses viewers into the concept of cosmic horror in 2D animation. The idea behind this project is to explore creative methods to create abstract and distorted animations that are both vivid and eerie, emphasizing the loneliness and desperation of the main protagonist on an unknown planet.
