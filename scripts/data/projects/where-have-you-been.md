Where have you been? invites participants to collaboratively map their global journeys and shared origins through playful drawing and digital visualization. Combining chalk-based interaction and an evolving digital map, it transforms personal travel narratives into a shared tapestry of cultural connection, illustrating how informal play and storytelling can foster community, empathy, and intercultural understanding.
