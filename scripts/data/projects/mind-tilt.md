(This is an Interactivity game made for Advanced Play Design space) Two players hold opposite sides of the board, each secretly choosing a colour. They tilt the board to move the ball, aiming to stop it on their colour when the 20-second timer ends. Stopping on the chosen colour earns 1 point. Then, each guesses the other’s colour—correct guesses earn 2 points.
