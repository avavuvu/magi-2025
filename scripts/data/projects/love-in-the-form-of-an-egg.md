"Love in the Form of an Egg" (2024) is a 2-minute frame-by-frame 2D animation for my final university assignment. The short animation depicts a girl struggling to cook a sentient egg creature that morphs into different types of eggs. The egg creature resembles the motions of a pet, creating all sorts of trouble for the girl. Despite the chaos between the two characters, the girl’s efforts to cook the egg were rewarded. The girl is revealed to have cooked this egg for her pet kitten, who eats the overcooked egg regardless and gives the girl loving head rubs. This is a metaphor for the animator’s struggles sharing her love for her new pet kitten, “Eggie”. As a new cat mother, she faced a lot of learning curves and misunderstandings. But at the end of the day, no matter the conflicts, the kitten returns the love through purrs and head rubs. To people who see themselves struggling to provide love and care to others, this animation encourages them that their efforts are more than enough. In the process of animating this work, scene compositions, the transformation of the egg character from one egg form to another, and the story progression were considered.
