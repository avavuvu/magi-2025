Fragrant Water is an interactive story game based on a Javanese Folktale called “Asal Usul Banyuwangi”. It explores the natural malleability of folklore using the affordance of game design and interactive storytelling. Fragrant Water allows you to follow the life of Sylo and decide whether to hold honor or loyalty and explore the three endings to reimagine the folktale.
