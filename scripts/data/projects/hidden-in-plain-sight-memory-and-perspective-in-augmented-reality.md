What if memory is fragile, emotional, and constantly reshaped by time, by feeling, and by the way we remember? In this video essay, I explore how augmented reality and anamorphic illusion can reframe our understanding of memory not as a static archive but as a shifting, interpretive experience shaped by perspective. I examine how visual storytelling and perceptual play can evoke emotional resonance and invite viewers to reconstruct meaning in fragmented digital spaces.
