I'm Dineth Meehitiya, a 3D Artist and Concept Artist based in Melbourne, originally from Sri Lanka and raised most of my life in Australia. I bring my imagination to life through digital sculpting, character art, modeling, and texturing. I use tools like Blender, ZBrush, Maya, Substance Painter, Photoshop, After Effects, UE5, Unity and DaVinci. I'm a hardworking, positive, and collaborative creative with a passion for films, games, anime, and metal/synth-pop music.
