Through the production of the short animation “The Husk”, the video will explore the definition of biomorphic art and how animators manipulate high contrast in movement, colours, textures, and visual ambiguity to depict unfathomable entities and psychological dissolution by using biomorphism. Furthermore, by using 2D animation, the role of sound design, pacing and narrative abstraction can be utilised in enhancing cosmic horror’s atmospheric terror. As a result, this video essay argues that by pushing biomorphic 2D animation, animators can be encouraged to produce hand-drawn media with unique artistic choices instead of traditional filmmaking approaches.
