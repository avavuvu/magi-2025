Liminal explores how gesture-based player agency in exploratory virtual reality games facilitates embodied non-human perspectives. While most VR design currently focuses on action-driven, human-centred experiences, Liminal offers a relaxing and aesthetic journey that shifts away from self-centredness. Player agency, gestural interactions, level and environment are designed to change playersâ€™ perception of scale and power. By seeing the world through the eyes of diverse forms of life, Liminal aims to foster awareness, empathy, and a sense of interconnectedness with all existence.
