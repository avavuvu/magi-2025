I am Alex-Haoduo Zhuang , an independent game developer and AI systems researcher. I focus on pioneering explorations in AI behavioral systems and their interaction with player psychological mechanisms.  My current research centers on non-dialogic NPC behavior modeling driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to:  - Enhance game replayability and tactical depth, - Lower the technical barriers for indie teams to develop high-quality intelligent enemies,  My research objective is to achieve higher-dimensional strategic complexity than traditional behavior tree systems by positioning LLMs as the tactical decision-making hub for NPC groups (akin to “Skynet” or a “tactical commander”).
