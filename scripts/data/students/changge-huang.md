I am a 2D hand-drawn animator exploring narrative techniques that reveal the subtle, inner worlds of characters. My work often blends emotional realism with poetic abstraction, seeking resonance through motion and silence. Through each frame, I aim to capture fleeting moments of humanity and introspection.
