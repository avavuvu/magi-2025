Hi, I'm Dineth Meehitiya a 3D Artist and Concept Artist based in Melbourne with a deep passion for bringing imagination to life through digital sculpting, character art, 3D modelling, and texturing. I specialize in using industry-standard tools such as Blender, ZBrush, Maya, Substance Painter, Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Unreal Engine, Unity and DaVinci Resolve to create my work. Born in Sri Lanka and raised in Australia, I've spent most of my life here, studying and honing my craft from a young age. Iâ€™m known for being a hard worker who always stays positive, collaborates well with others, and pushes every project to its full potential. My inspirations come from films, games, anime, and music especially metal and synth-pop which fuel my creativity.
