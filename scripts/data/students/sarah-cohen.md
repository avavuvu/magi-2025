I am Sarah, an artist with a Bachelor of Natural History Illustration and a Masterâ€™s in Animation, Games and Interactivity. My work blends art and science, inspired by my love of nature. Through 2D animation and illustration, I explore the beauty and complexity of the natural world, aiming to spark curiosity and appreciation for the environments and organisms that surround us.
