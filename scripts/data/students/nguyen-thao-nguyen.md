Nguyen is a passionate 3D Designer and Motion Graphic Artist driven by curiosity and a love for experimentation. I believe creativity is not a straight line, it comes from constant tinkering, trying new ideas, and learning from every process. Iâ€™m always eager to explore new tools, technologies, and workflows to push my creative and technical boundaries, delivering distinctive and high-quality visual outcomes
