performance and video art. They are currently finishing their Masters of Animation, Games and Interactive Media at RMIT. They explore intersections of popular culture and current digital technologies specific to games and interactive media, striving to queer normative
ideals and conventions, and to experiment with more diverse forms of embodied expressions, inclusivity and community connection through play.
","This video essay presents the development of the game Dance Dance Deception (Lou Fourie 2024), which was undertaken as a practice-based research project. It is a janky dance game that explicitly demands skillful control and winning a competition, simultaneously breaking down (the curse of the rave demon is taking over!), rendering these serious goals absurd and revealing surprising possibilities for play. This work contributes to current discussions in queer games studies that relate jank in games to queer forms of play.
I trace examples from my process of intentionally failing at normative expectations and consciously re-orientating myself as entangled with software, a bumbling and defiant queer cyborg.
I propose revelling in unexpected behaviour of digital things, as opposed to dominating control over them. I hope to demonstrate possibilities that can emerge from naivete and celebrating jank. I hope my small examples can embolden other inexpert game makers to defy exclusionary ideals and bumble their way into making messy queer games.

- Enhance game replayability and tactical depth,
