The shape of a tear is a short non-linear animation that explores the potential of showing sadness through fragile symbols and unanimated objects such as: glasses, flowers and urban scenes. The film using movement like: melting, morphing to visualizes sadness through the transformation of objects and environments. It is looking to replacing character-driven narratives with abstract shifts in forms, and movement, constructed by hybrid motion graphic and hand-drawn. Inspired by how images can evoke emotions through movement, time, and perception without narrative, the project focus on showing what audiences can resonate emotionally through the movement and deformation of stylized objects.
