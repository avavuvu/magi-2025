This video essay explores how Indonesian folktales, particularly a Javanese story, can be authentically adapted into games to preserve cultural values. Using the prototype game Fragrant Water, it applies an Interactive Digital Narrative framework to analyze narrative design, player agency, and engagement, demonstrating how game can sustain cultural continuity while innovating storytelling.
