HUMAN.EXE - AI Commander is a Unity-based 2D top-down tactical shooter integrating DeepSeek API-powered LLM as a strategic AI commander. Rather than controlling individual enemy units, the LLM serves as high-level tactical intelligence, analyzing battlefield situations and issuing strategic commands while traditional AI handles execution. This hybrid architecture addresses solo developers' resource constraints, enabling sophisticated enemy coordination without extensive behavior tree programming. The system uses JSON schema-driven structured outputs for real-time Unity-LLM communication.
