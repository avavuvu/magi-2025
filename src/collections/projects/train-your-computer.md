The Expo version differs from the one shown above. It uses facial recognition to read the player’s expressions. Every 5 seconds, an image of the dog’s behavior appears, and the player reacts with a happy or sad face. If the player dislikes a behavior more often, that image will appear less frequently later—just like training a real dog to learn what to do or avoid.
