“Tethered Thoughts” is an abstract 2D animation exploring the turbulence of creative block. A young artist drifts in and out of her own thoughts—at first finding inspiration, then sinking into self-doubt as towering versions of herself loom with skepticism. Through shifting geometric transformations, she battles the weight of inner criticism until finally confronting it head-on, transforming the pressure into a vibrant landscape. The film reflects on the struggle, and ultimate resilience, of the creative process.
