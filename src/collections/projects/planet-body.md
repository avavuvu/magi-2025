PLANET BODY is a narrative driven story game about living with the struggles of a chronic illness and the toll that it takes on an individual’s mental health. This involves overcoming both physical challenges such as reduced mobility and fatigue, and mental challenges like self-esteem and self-perception. My aim for this project is to create a digital experience that represents the impact of chronic pain and illness. This includes direct affects an individual’s capacity to complete tasks within their daily life, as well as world view, mental health, relationship with environment and social relationships.
