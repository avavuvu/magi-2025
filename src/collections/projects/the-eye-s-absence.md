To simulate the real-life process of losing and finding objects, players use their eyes to switch between two states: eyes open to see visuals, eyes closed to hear sound cues and voice hints. Across different scenes and themes, players must locate a randomly generated target using separate visual and auditory clues. A time limit in each round reinforces the concept of loss and discovery.
