An experimental APD project that explores charm & quirkyness in the mundane, by letting the guests help themselves to googly eyes where they can place & stick anywhere, maybe tag a custom social page & the page will update it will eyes people placed in the expo, maybe the EXPO will be covered in googly eyes by the end?
