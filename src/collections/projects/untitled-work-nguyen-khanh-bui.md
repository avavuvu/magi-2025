Synopsis:  A stranded astronaut fights for survival on a hostile planet that warps his body and mind, tormented by a hidden entity that feeds on his suffering and loneliness in a twisted act of love.  Context:  “The Husk” is a hand-drawn animated short that immerses viewers into the concept of cosmic horror in 2D animation. The idea behind this project is to explore creative methods to create abstract and distorted animations that are both vivid and eerie, emphasising the loneliness and desperation of the main protagonist on an unknown planet.  Action:  My responsibilities encompassed the entire pipeline from concept to completion, including character animation, concept art, character design and background design. By combining Photoshop, Clip Studio Pro, and Procreate Dream in my design process, the project yielded a plethora of distinct illustrations, concepts, and designs that elevate the tone and depth of the short.  Result:   The short animation is the culmination of my dedicated effort to refine my personal artistic style. The struggle and tragic fate of the protagonist were executed effectively with the stark contrast between beauty and ugliness, abnormality and normality in design philosophy.
