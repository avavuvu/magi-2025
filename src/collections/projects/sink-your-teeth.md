This is an adventure game where you get to use your mouth just like a real mouse, biting, breaking things, and interacting with the world around you.  Itâ€™s a short adventure, about ten minutes long. You play as a sneaky mouse exploring a stylish human world. By making biting sounds and mouth movements, you can destroy obstacles, move objects, and eat food. You also have to be careful not to get caught by humans while you explore!
