Imagine being a powerful cosmic entity, then gradually shrinking into a butterfly, or even smaller as a plankton... Liminal is an existential gesture-based VR game where you can see the world through the eyes of various creatures by moving your hands to fly or swim. Immerse yourself in this mind-opening journey that shows just how small humans are in this amazing, vast world. Human is only a drop in the ocean, part of a continuum of life far greater than us.
