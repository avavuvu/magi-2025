"Nurture" is a 2D animated short film that tells the story of a small cactus's journey towards recovery and self-realization in an environment of material deprivation and emotional indifference. Set against the vast expanse of a desert landscape, the story centers on a family of three: a caring yet partial mother, a favored elder brother, and a neglected younger brother who serves as the protagonist.
