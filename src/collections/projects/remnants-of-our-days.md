Remnants of Our Days is a 3D exploration game set in an afterlife realm where spirits linger in the eternal season of their passing. Players take on the role of a Soul Mender, tasked with reuniting wandering spirits with their lost pets as a trial to prove their love for Miu - their companion throughout different lives.
