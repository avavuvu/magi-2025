I am Yu-Chi Huang(Doris), currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Animation, Games, and Interactivity at RMIT University, Australia. I specialize in creating with mixed media and enjoy experimenting with diverse creative approaches. My expertise spans motion design and graphic design, with a current focus on interaction design. I aim to integrate real-life experiences into interactive design to craft sensory experiences that are both engaging and contemplative.  I am Tania Olarte, a Multimedia Specialist currently studying a Master’s in Animation and Video Games at RMIT. I enjoy creating interactive experiences that blend storytelling, art, and play. My interests include exploring how games and animation can express emotions, spark curiosity, and connect people through creative interaction.
