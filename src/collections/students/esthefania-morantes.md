Esthefania is a game designer and illustrator with a background in graphic design. Her practice centers on creating games that subvert expectations by telling deeper stories through visually engaging and deceptively “cute” characters. Currently, she is expanding her creative approach by exploring unconventional platforms and interactive methods, including TouchDesigner, embodied interaction, and augmented reality (AR), integrating experimental tools into her projects and experiences.
