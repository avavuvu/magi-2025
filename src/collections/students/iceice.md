I am a graphic designer and animation director whose work is often inspired by nature, urban landscapes, and the gentle presence of everyday life. My practice can be seen as a soft archive—one that preserves care, sorrow, and memory, while reflecting on fleeting, fragile, yet beautiful moments. In a world preoccupied with permanence and speed, I aim to redefine “slowness,” “fragility,” and “ambiguity” as strengths rather than flaws.
