I’ve worked on 3D animation, architectural and landscape visualization, and participated in VR and 360-video production projects. I’m currently diving into Unreal Engine 5 game development — always learning new skills with the hope of making a living from them one day. Until then, I’m still doing food delivery — but ever since I learned to ride a motorbike, getting deliveries done faster has actually been pretty fun.
