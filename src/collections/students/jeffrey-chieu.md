Hey I’m Jeffrey! I am currently a MAGI student here at RMIT, with a background in Fine Arts during my undergraduate studies, where my main area of focus is in 2D animation. Within MAGI, I’ve had opportunities to further expand my practice into other fields and disciplines, whether that’s through experimental animation involving mix medium and stop motion, storyline narrative development writing or making social interactive games for my friends and peers to play test.
