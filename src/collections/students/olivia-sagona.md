I’m Olivia Sagona, also known as Yibblet—a Melbourne-based graphic designer, illustrator, and animator with a passion for bold visuals and quirky characters. My work spans branding, animation, and illustration, often exploring surrealist ideas and playful motion to create stories that leave a lasting impression.
