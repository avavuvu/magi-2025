The protagonist and their cat, MiMi, were once a pair of seafaring companions—a fisherman and a feline. But after being caught in a violent storm, they drift ashore on a mysterious island. Once a densely populated fishing village, the island is now overrun by eerie sea creatures and lingering ghostly souls. The air is damp and chilling, the seawater glimmers unnaturally, and strange organic matter seeps from stone walls—everything hints that something that shouldn’t exist has made its way onto land.
