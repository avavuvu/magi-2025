Growing up in Vietnam, I came to Australia to pursue my passion for animation. I love embracing new challenges and creative opportunities with an open mindset and fast learning ability. My strengths lie in character design, background design, and animation, where I combine my technical skills with creative artistic direction using tools such as Toon Boom Harmony and Moho 14. This portfolio offers a glimpse into my 2D animation journey, showcasing my abilities and a unique perspective on storytelling and design language. When I’m not at work, I’m constantly gathering new ideas from my beloved art books, indie games, or my travels to new places.
